          parallax: noun \ˈpa-rə-ˌlaks\: the apparent displacement or the
          difference in apparent direction of an object as seen from two
          different points not on a straight line with the object.

        <h1>Our Approach</h1>
        <p>
          One of the primary things that stand out about Parallax Global is our
          unique point-of-view and approach to consulting engagements. The lens
          through which we view every consulting engagement is a Parallax View,
          which of course, as the definition of "parallax" suggests, means that
          we take two alternate (but not necessarily opposing) views of every
          problem, and compare and contrast two alternate strategies for
          approaching the problem. This ensures that individuals, teams and
          management do not become victims of their own paradigms (read Thomas
          Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions for more on this), that
          we don't get lazy, and that we can assure our clients of the deepest
          and most creative approaches to their problems, every time.
        </p>
        <h2>A Parallax Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          As we use the term, we mean taking a look at a task, assignment,
          problem from two different points-of-view. To do this, we assign two
          different teams to engage with an assignment and develop their own
          points of view, and then present their views to three referees, who
          then decide, based on the information that we have, which is the
          better initial path to pursue. But that is only the beginning of the
          process. Throughout the engagement, we continue to use both points of
          view as a way of illuminating the "space between them," and achieve
          greater clarity of observation and effectiveness of action. In this
          way, we protect ourselves from falling victim to reinforcing our own
          paradigms. Modeled after the great Greek Philosophy, our Parallax view
          outlines two opposing approaches to the problems we try to collaborate
          with our clients and resolve. On one hand we use empiricism, viewing
          what we know from the physical (senses) perspective. We see, we feel,
          we acquire through being on the ground, talking to people, observing,
          touching others creations. On the other hand we use rationalism,
          thinking, reasoning, hypothesizing and abstracting on the way to
          determine possible courses of action. We also use ethics, the deep
          understanding of good and bad, right or wrong, just or not – in short
          morality. Our views, our processes and our protocols have been honed
          over and over again, with time, maturing and advancing over time, as
          we have grown as an organization. We share these with our people, we
          share it with our clients, and we share it with the world in our quest
          to Parallax things for the greater good.
