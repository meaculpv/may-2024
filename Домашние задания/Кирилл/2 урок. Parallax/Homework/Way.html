        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>
          We envision a world that works well. Where many disparate parts come
          together with energy, synergy, and synchronicity to form a more
          valuable, more connected, more innovative, and more rewarding whole.
          We believe that, while we can't create perfection, we can strive for
          it. While we can't make others accept new ideas, new processes, and
          new results, we can make it possible for people to see the benefits
          with greater clarity. We work, every day, toward making our vision a
          reality by never forgetting what it is, by keeping our mission and our
          values central to our core beliefs and work, and by remaining positive
          that we live in a world where ideas and people can, should, and must
          make a difference.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
          Our mission is to change the world, and to help our clients change it.
          That's why "Change the world." is the default screen saver on Parallax
          computers. Why it's the large sculpture in the entryway of each of our
          offices. And why it's the theme line we use in all of our
          communications. We know change is the new constant; it's all around us
          and dealing with it is challenging. We therefore strive to make it
          easier for our clients, partners and workforce to learn how to use
          various perspectives in observing, understanding and addressing it.
          Our way is not the only way. We recognize and respect different
          approaches to the same challenge.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Values</h3>
        <p>
          We accomplish our mission and fulfill our vision by adhering to our
          core values:
        </p>
        <img src="images/team.jpg" alt="team" />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Integrity:</b> We adhere to the highest ethical standards:
            honesty and fairness are the foundations of our actions. We take
            pride in our honest dealing with others irrespective of nationality,
            culture or belief.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Respect:</b> We respect the rights, beliefs, and differences of
            our colleagues, our clients, our partners, and other citizens of the
            world. We treat others with care, dignity, equality and trust.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Accountability:</b> We meet or exceed our commitments, and take
            responsibility for our performance in all of our decisions and
            actions. We remain accountable to our highest standards and to those
            who expect the best from us and who provide us with business.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Innovation:</b> We constantly look for and develop new ways to
            deliver value to our clients, our partners, and our global
            community. We look to the horizon and anticipate what new problems
            are coming, and what new solutions can be developed to meet them. We
            innovate in thought, in action and in finding ways to do things more
            effectively, more efficiently and more productively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Teamwork:</b> We work together in diverse and unified teams, at
            every level of the organization. We do that because we believe that
            teamwork is what makes us stronger. We help each other and by doing
            that help ourselves be better, stronger and united.
