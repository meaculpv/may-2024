    <h1>Mexican Oil Reserves</h1>
    <p>
      Mexico recently completed a new assessment of its oil reserves and
      estimated proven and probable oil reserves at approximately 18.7 billion
      barrels. Mexico’s earlier assessment in 2007 estimated reserves at
      approximately 12.4 billion barrels in all country resources, but in 2011,
      the estimate was revised to 15.7 billion barrels to reflect additional
      exploration findings. Discoveries in the Sigsbee Field increase this
      figure by an additional 3 billion barrels.
    </p>
    <h2>Sigsbee Field</h2>
    <p>
      The Sigsbee Field is one of the largest gas and crude oil fields in the
      Gulf of Mexico, with new advances in seismic imaging and drilling leading
      to the discovery of this new field. This offshore oil field is located
      approximately 150 km southeast from the city of Matamoros on the east
      coast of Mexico in what is often referred to as the “Grand Canyon under
      the sea.” Covering an area 30 by 15 square kilometers (12 by 5.8 sq. mi),
      the Sigsbee discovery is estimated to contain 1.2 trillion cubic meters
      (42 trillion cubic feet) of gas and up to 3 billion barrels of liquid
      crude oil. At its largest point, the field contains a gas column that is
      being drilled in water that is more than 2,000 meters deep. To date, the
      field has been drilled to a depth of 5,861 meters. Mexico and the United
      States are involved negotiations to secure access to this source of oil
      and gas.

    <h2>Four Integral Components</h2>
    <p>
      The Sigsbee Field is comprised of the following four integral components:
      Ojeda, Arana, Quiroga, and Orizba. These components are responsible for
      the production, processing and transportation of oil and gas from the
      field.
    </p>
    <h3>Ojeda Oil and Gas Processing Plant</h3>
    <img src="images/ojeda.jpg" alt="ojeda" />
    <p>
      Ojeda is an oil and gas processing plant located 32km (20 mi) northeast of
      San Fernando, Mexico. The facility is 19 km (12 mi) wide and 21 km (13 mi)
      long. Constructed in 1989, Ojeda is one of the largest crude oil and gas
      processing plant facilities in Mexico. The city of San Fernando is the
      main transport hub of Ojeda oil from the Gulf of Mexico Sigsbee field to
      inner-lying cities within the country.

    <h3>Arana Spar</h3>
    <img src="images/arana.jpg" alt="arana" />
    <p>
      Arana spar is located on the maritime border between Mexico and the United
      States, approximately 120 kilometers (75 mi) west of Matamoros. Arana is
      the second highest producing in the field, behind Quiroga, and is the
      primary tie-in point connecting the field to Ojeda processing plant. Arana
      produced 4.6 tons of crude oil in 2010.
    </p>
    <a href="#">Go Back</a>
    <h3>Quiroga Rig</h3>
    <img src="images/quiroga.jpg" alt="quiroga" />
    <p>
      The Quiroga is the highest producing component of the Sigsbee Field, with
      more than a third of the discovered natural resources being drilled and
      produced from four wells. The offshore oil rig – a semi-submersible – is
      located south of the Arana spar and southwest of the Orizba, tying into
      the Arana to transport crude oil production back to the Ojeda plant, The
      Quiroga produced over 5.4 tons of crude oil in 2010, with production
      continuing to increase at a steady rate as additional wells are added and
      new techniques such as water injections, are used to stimulate production.

    <h3>Orizba Rig</h3>
    <img src="images/orizba.jpg" alt="orizba" />
    <p>
      The Orizba is an ultra deepwater drillship equipped to drill in 3,048 m
      (10,000 ft) of water, situated directly over the deepest part of the
      valley along which Sigsbee field is located. At its largest point, the
      reservoir contains a gas column 1,450 meters (4,760 ft.) deep with a 200
      meters (660 ft.) deep oil rim below it. The Orizba is located directly
      over this gas column. It is estimated the gas column contains
      approximately 1.2 trillion cubic meters (42 trillion cubic feet) of gas,
      and the Orizba is set to produce this gas as well as more than 4.2 tons of
      crude oil per year.
