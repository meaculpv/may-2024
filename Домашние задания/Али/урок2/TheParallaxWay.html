    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We envision a world that works well. Where many disparate parts come
      together with energy, synergy, and synchronicity to form a more valuable,
      more connected, more innovative, and more rewarding whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that, while we can't create perfection, we can strive for it.
      While we can't make others accept new ideas, new processes, and new
      results, we can make it possible for people to see the benefits with
      greater clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work, every day, toward making our vision a reality by never forgetting
      what it is, by keeping our mission and our values central to our core
      beliefs and work, and by remaining positive that we live in a world where
      ideas and people can, should, and must make a difference.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to change the world, and to help our clients change it.
      That's why "Change the world." is the default screen saver on Parallax
      computers. Why it's the large sculpture in the entryway of each of our
      offices. And why it's the theme line we use in all of our communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know change is the new constant; it's all around us and dealing with it
      is challenging. We therefore strive to make it easier for our clients,
      partners and workforce to learn how to use various perspectives in
      observing, understanding and addressing it. Our way is not the only way.
      We recognize and respect different approaches to the same challenge.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <p>
      We accomplish our mission and fulfill our vision by adhering to our core
      values:
    </p>
    <blockquote><img src="images/team.jpg" alt="team" /></blockquote>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Integrity:</b> We adhere to the highest ethical standards: honesty
        and fairness are the foundations of our actions. We take pride in our
        honest dealing with others irrespective of nationality, culture or
        belief.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Respect:</b> We respect the rights, beliefs, and differences of our
        colleagues, our clients, our partners, and other citizens of the world.
        We treat others with care, dignity, equality and trust.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Accountability:</b> We meet or exceed our commitments, and take
        responsibility for our performance in all of our decisions and actions.
        We remain accountable to our highest standards and to those who expect
        the best from us and who provide us with business.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Innovation:</b> We constantly look for and develop new ways to
        deliver value to our clients, our partners, and our global community. We
        look to the horizon and anticipate what new problems are coming, and
        what new solutions can be developed to meet them. We innovate in
        thought, in action and in finding ways to do things more effectively,
        more efficiently and more productively.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Teamwork:</b> We work together in diverse and unified teams, at every
        level of the organization. We do that because we believe that teamwork
        is what makes us stronger. We help each other and by doing that help
        ourselves be better, stronger and united.
      </li>
    </ul>
