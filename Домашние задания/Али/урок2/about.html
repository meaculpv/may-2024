      <b>parallax: noun \ˈpa-rə-ˌlaks</b>\: the apparent displacement or the
      difference in apparent direction of an object as seen from two different
      points not on a straight line with the object.

    <h1>Our approach</h1>
    <p>
      One of the primary things that stand out about Parallax Global is our
      unique point-of-view and approach to consulting engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lens through which we view every consulting engagement is a Parallax
      View, which of course, as the definition of "parallax" suggests, means
      that we take two alternate (but not necessarily opposing) views of every
      problem, and compare and contrast two alternate strategies for approaching
      the problem. This ensures that individuals, teams and management do not
      become victims of their own paradigms (read Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of
      Scientific Revolutions for more on this), that we don't get lazy, and that
      we can assure our clients of the deepest and most creative approaches to
      their problems, every time.
    </p>
    <h2>A Parallax Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      As we use the term, we mean taking a look at a task, assignment, problem
      from two different points-of-view. To do this, we assign two different
      teams to engage with an assignment and develop their own points of view,
      and then present their views to three referees, who then decide, based on
      the information that we have, which is the better initial path to pursue.
      But that is only the beginning of the process.
    </p>
    <img src="images/perspective.jpg" alt="perspective" />
    <p>
      Throughout the engagement, we continue to use both points of view as a way
      of illuminating the "space between them," and achieve greater clarity of
      observation and effectiveness of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, we protect ourselves from falling victim to reinforcing our
      own paradigms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modeled after the great Greek Philosophy, our Parallax view outlines two
      opposing approaches to the problems we try to collaborate with our clients
      and resolve. On one hand we use empiricism, viewing what we know from the
      physical (senses) perspective. We see, we feel, we acquire through being
      on the ground, talking to people, observing, touching others creations. On
      the other hand we use rationalism, thinking, reasoning, hypothesizing and
      abstracting on the way to determine possible courses of action. We also
      use ethics, the deep understanding of good and bad, right or wrong, just
      or not – in short morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our views, our processes and our protocols have been honed over and over
      again, with time, maturing and advancing over time, as we have grown as an
      organization. We share these with our people, we share it with our
      clients, and we share it with the world in our quest to Parallax things
      for the greater good.
